## Description

<!--
Briefly and clearly describe the proposal.
Explain the general need and the advantages of this specific proposal.
If relevant, include examples of how the new functionality would be used,
intended use-cases, and pseudo-code illustrating its use.
-->

Accessibility is about making the world accessible to the full range of human experience, which includes disabilities.
For example, the physical world can be made more accessible for wheelchair users by having more buildings with ramps.
Not only should the physical world be accessible, but the digital world as well.

More and more people are accessing the world digitally.
Access to the internet is a human right.[citation for UN].
With access to the internet, people can access vital information, such as education [citation for various country laws to access education] or their banking information.

People with disabilities access the internet as well.
Blind users can access text on websites with assistive technology such as a screen-reader, which verbally reads text out loud.
Thus assistive technology empower disabled people to live autonomous lives.

An accessible world allows people with disabilities to not only access information, but also communicate and create.
Helen Keller’s access to Braille, another form of assistive technology, allowed her to read about the world.
She used Braille to communicate with others who were Deaf-Blind.
It also allowed her to publish her experiences [citation for Story of My Life] and advocate for the Deaf-Blind community to the general public.

Accessibility benefits everyone.
For example, captions for videos benefit not only Deaf viewers with complete hearing loss, but also viewers with partial hearing loss due to age.
Captions also benefit viewers who cannot play audio out loud, such as in a quiet environment or if they have broken speakers.
[citation to range of disabilities and situational disability].
Thus accessibility benefits not just “a few disabled people”[a] but all people.

## Implementation

# Description

The Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination (SPEC) process is managed by
the SPEC Steering Committee (SSC).
The SCC does not decide which SPECs are adopted—that choice resides with
individual projects.
They do, however, 
- monitor and discuss new ideas for SPEC documents in the
  [Discussions](https://github.com/scientific-python/specs/discussions/categories/ideas)
  forum,
- determine which new ideas are assigned a SPEC number as described in
  [MetaSPEC 0 — Purpose and Process]({{< relref "/specs/meta-spec-0000.md" >}}),
- decide whether new MetaSPECS (i.e., SPECS about SPECS)
  are accepted and approve any changes to them, and
- serve as a communication channel to and from their projects as well
  as the larger ecosystem.

# Implementation

## Decision making and communication

The SSC makes decisions through group consensus and, in the very rare instance
where no consensus can be reached, by two-thirds majority vote of those
available to cast a vote within ten days.

Communication within the SSC takes place via the email group at ...  SSC
members are expected to be aware of conversations on this list to lean validity
to consensus seeking and voting.

## Membership

There are no term limits to the SPEC Steering Committee (SSC)—projects may
replace their representatives at will, or choose not to participate.
New projects are invited by the SSC.

## MetaSPECs

Alterations to MetaSPECs have to be approved by the SSC.

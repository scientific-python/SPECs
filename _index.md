SPECs provide operational guidelines for projects in the scientific Python ecosystem.
All community members and ecosystem projects are welcome to participate in the SPEC process.
The SPEC process is described in the
[SPEC Purpose and Process]({{< relref "/specs/purpose-and-process" >}}),
[SPEC Steering Committee]({{< relref "/specs/steering-committee" >}}), and
[SPEC Core Projects]({{< relref "/specs/core-projects" >}}) documents.
Community discussions take place on the
[`SPECs` Discourse forum](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/specs/6).

Contributors must adhere to our [code of conduct]({{< relref "/code_of_conduct.md" >}}).

SPEC development takes place at https://github.com/scientific-python/specs.

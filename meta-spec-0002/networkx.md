# What is NetworkX?

<!--
In one or two sentences, describe what your package does.
-->

NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the
structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
It aims to be the reference library for network science algorithms in Python


# How is it used in scientific research?

<!--
In one or two paragraphs, describe how this project is used in scientific research.
-->

Networks, or graphs, describe relationships between pairs of objects (such as proteins or
genes) called nodes. Network analysis allows researchers to measure and control the
network topology, including the importance and similarity of nodes,
and to identify structures that are similar across networks.
NX contributes to the advancement of science in this area: Google Scholar
reports that 82 papers with the key phrase "biological networks" were
published in 2019 citing NX.  The major NX algorithms currently used by
biologists include community detection, subgraph isomorphism, image analysis
(via scikit-image), and centrality measures.

# What is the development community like?

<!--
In one or two paragraphs, describe your developer team.
How many people are on the core developer team?
Where do developers come from (e.g., do new contributors just show up or are they hired)?
Is it all voluteers?
How do new contributors become core developers?
-->

# How does it exchange data with projects in the ecosystem?

<!--
Briefly describe how data is exchanged between your projects and other
projects in the ecosystem.

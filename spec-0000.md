# Description

The Scientific Python Ecosystem (SPE), informally defined, is a loose federation of projects that interact well with one another and that follow similar norms of development, documentation, testing, and so forth.

This SPEC clarifies the attributes a project should have to be considered a core part of the ecosystem.  The purpose of the list is not to exclude any projects (indeed, a project may be a member of the *community* without adhering to this SPEC); rather, it provides a goalpost and developmental milestone to strive towards in order for a package to be considered mature.

## Attributes of Packages in the Scientific Python Ecosystem

### ✓ **Is used in scientific research**

The SPE is focused on packages with a scientific research purpose.  Of course, these tools are often used for other purposes too, and the SPE overlaps with the PyData ecosystem---which has a stronger focus on solving problems in industry.

### ✓ **Has a liberal license**

SPE packages have liberal open source licenses.  The 3-clause (also called "modified" or "new") BSD license is by far the most common.  Whatever license is chosen should adhere to the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd-annotated).

### ✓ **Is well documented**

Packages must document their APIs, and have inline documentation (most often in the form of [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/) or [napoleon](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/).

### ✓ **Is well tested**

Packages should have a high level of test coverage to ensure that a) the code does what it is intended to and b) new developers can modify the code without fear of breaking it.

### ✓ **Is developed in the open by its community**

SPE packages are developed by their communities.  Development takes place in an online forum, and communications are public.  The developers of the project do not all reside at a single institution.

Some very small projects may not qualify under this rule as being part of the core ecosystem, but should qualify as soon as they build a larger community of users and developers.

### ✓ **Uses common data exchange mechanisms**

Unless a package itself provides data exchange, it should support standard mechanisms for data exchange.  Array data, e.g., should support NumPy or similar.  This ensures that core packages can "talk" to one another.

# Implementation

Projects that have the attributes described above are invited to file a pull request to add themselves to the 'adopted-by' field of this SPEC.

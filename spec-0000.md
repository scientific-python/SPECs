# Description

This SPEC recommends that all projects across the Scientific Python
ecosystem adopt a common time-based policy for dropping
support of older Python, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib versions.
We recommend that projects drop support for versions of Python 42 months after
its intial release and for versions of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib 24 months
after their intial releases.

## Motivation

For users:
 - Access to bugfixes/features

For maintainers:
 - Reduce maintenance burden related to supporting older versions
 - Reduce the need for "workarounds" for older software versions
 - Reduce infrastructure burdens, e.g. CI test matrices.

For the ecosystem:
 - Adopting the standard improves coordination across projects and reduces
   burdens related to cross-project decision-making.

## Background
 - In the past, longer support cycles were more common due to:
   * The need to support both Python2 and Python3
   * The difficulty of installing/maintaining multiple Python versions.
     - Long-term support (LTS) platforms (RHEL, some Ubuntus) often have "old"
       Python versions as the default.
 - The situation has now improved due to:
   * Ease of installing libraries (wheels)
   * Dropping official support for Python2 (Jan 2020)
   * Package managers making it easier to install/maintain/switch between
     multiple Python versions on any platform (e.g. `conda`).

# Implementation

Projects adopting this SPEC should create a PR
(https://github.com/scientific-python/scientific-python.org/pulls) to add their
names to the list below:

- [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx)


# Notes

- This builds on [NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html),
  which describes several alternatives including ad-Hoc version support, all
  CPython supported versions, default version on Linux distribution, N minor
  versions of Python, and time window from the X.Y.1 Python release.

- Code to generate support and drop schedule tables:

# Description

The SPEC process is managed by the Steering Committee.
In particular, the Steering Committee members

- monitor and moderate the
  [SPECs discussion forum](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/specs/6),
- determine which proposed SPECs are accepted as described in the SPEC
  [Purpose and Process]({{< relref "/specs/purpose-and-process" >}}),
- suggest and approve changes to the SPEC process including any changes to the
  [SPEC Purpose and Process]({{< relref "/specs/purpose-and-process" >}}),
  [SPEC Steering Committee]({{< relref "/specs/steering-committee" >}}), and
  [SPEC Core Projects]({{< relref "/specs/core-projects" >}}), as well as
- serve as a communication channel to and from projects they contribute to as
  well as the larger ecosystem.

The Steering Committee does not decide which SPECs are adopted—that
choice resides with individual projects.
Similarly, the Steering Committee does not decide which SPECs are endorsed—that
choice resides with individual core projects.

## Steering Committee

# Implementation

To accept a SPEC (i.e., to assign it a SPEC number and merge the PR)
requires two members of the Steering Committee to approve and no members objecting.
Since the role of the Steering Committee is mainly to ensure that SPEC proposals are
appropriate, objections should be rare.

The Steering Committee makes decisions through group consensus and, in the very rare instance
where no consensus can be reached, by two-thirds majority vote of those
available to cast a vote within ten days.

Public communication takes place in the
[`specs` GitHub repository](https://github.com/scientific-python/specs/)
and the [SPECs discussion forum](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/specs/6).
Private communication within the Steering Committee takes place on
[Steering Committee private mailing list](https://groups.io/g/spec-steering-committee/).
Steering Committee members are expected to be aware of conversations on this list to lend validity
to consensus-seeking and voting.

## Who should be a member?

Members of the Steering Committee should be active in the scientific Python ecosystem and
should have a demonstrated interest in the SPECs.
Examples of demonstrated interest include submitting SPECs, engaging in SPEC
discussions, reviewing SPEC PRs, or advocating for wider SPEC participation.

## How many members should there be?

This is up to the Steering Committee.
However, if the Steering Committee is unable to quickly handle new SPEC proposals and new ideas arising
in the discussions aren't addressed in a timely manner, the Steering Committee should try to
recruit new members.

## How do you add a member?

If the Steering Committee decides to admit a new member and that person agrees,
then they should
(1) be added to the Steering Committee member listing above,
(2) be added to the
[Steering Committee Team](https://github.com/orgs/scientific-python/teams/spec-steering-committee/members),
(3) be added to the [Steering Committee private mailing list](https://groups.io/g/spec-steering-committee/members).

## How do you remove a member?

If a member wishes to resign or if the Steering Committee decides to remove a member,
then they should
(1) be moved to the list of Emeritus Steering Committee members (below the list of active members),
(2) be removed from the
[Steering Committee Team](https://github.com/orgs/scientific-python/teams/spec-steering-committee/members),
(3) be removed from the [Steering Committee private mailing list](https://groups.io/g/spec-steering-committee/members).

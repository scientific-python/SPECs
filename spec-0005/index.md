- Recommend that CI running against PRs be expected to pass--if it fails, it should be important

- Schedule regular runs of CI against nightlies/pre-releases

  - Good for other checks that don't need to run on every PR
  - Could use for pins
  - Can use labels to trigger additional runs of "exotic" jobs
  - Can open an issue on failure rather than hiding in a UI somewhere--helps give notifications
  - Generate a badge for the workflow, that can be collected into a dashboard

- GitHub actions security concerns
  - Need to trust action creators
  - Pin to hash vs. version/tag?
